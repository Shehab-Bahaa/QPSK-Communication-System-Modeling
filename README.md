# QPSKCommunicationSystem_Simulation

This project is the course project of 'Communications Theory and Systems - NANENG 461' It's a course offered in the 4th year, Electronics engineering program at University of Science and Technology, Zewail City, Egypt.

The project involved:
  -Modeling QPSK modulation and demodulation. 
  -Modeling Rayleigh and Rician fading channels.
  -Analyzing the digital communication system under various channel conditions using constellation diagram and bit error rate (BER).
  -Testing the digital communication system by sending and receiving an image.
