# QPSKCommunicationSystem_Simulation

This project is the course project of 'Communications Theory and Systems - NANENG 461' It's a course offered in the 4th year, Electronics engineering program at University of Science and Technology, Zewail City, Egypt.

The project involved: <br /> 
  -Modeling QPSK modulation and demodulation. <br /> 
  -Modeling Rayleigh and Rician fading channels. <br /> 
  -Analyzing the digital communication system under various channel conditions using constellation diagram and bit error rate (BER). <br /> 
  -Testing the digital communication system by sending and receiving an image. <br />
